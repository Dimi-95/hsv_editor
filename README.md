# hsv_editor
An editor that is meant to change the HSV-vlaues of an image. 


- This is part of a bigger project that uses openCV. 
- The Editor changes the HSV Values of an image, making it easier to change an image to the point where you can pick out the color of an object, which has a stark contract to the background, after it was edited by the HSV Editor. This will make it easier for openCV to track that object.
- The Editor is supposed to output the HSV Values after it is done, possibly to a text file, so that it is easier to implement these values in the actual image tracking software  [WIP]
