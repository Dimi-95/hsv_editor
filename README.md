# hsv_editor
An editor that is meant to change the HSV-vlaues of an image. 


- This is part of a bigger project that uses openCV. 
- The Editor changes the HSV Values of an image, making it easier to change an image to the point where you can pick out the color of an object, which has a stark contract to the background, after it was edited by the HSV Editor. This will make it easier for openCV to track that object.
- Editor outputs HSV Values into a text file when it saves the modifed image.
- Functions:
-- Saves image and the adjusted HSV Values 
-- Resets the whole program - giving the ability to edit instantly a new image
